DESCRIPTION
-----------
Implements MineWhat Ecommerce tracking for OpenCart;
> Tracks regular page views
> Tracks Ecommerce product views

OpenCart admin backend for modifying settings.
Fully VQmod'ed up! Does NOT overwrite any core files.



IMPORTANT
---------
1. Requires VQmod installed (Highly recommended - https://code.google.com/p/vqmod/ ).

2. Requires MineWhat installed.


INSTALL
-------
1) Upload the contents of the 'Upload' directory to the root of your OpenCart site.
2) Login to your OpenCart admin, go to the Extensions -> Modules page, and click 'Install' next to ‘MineWhat Analytics Ecommerce'.
3) After install, click 'Edit' next to ‘MineWhat Analytics, and on the settings page enter the details;

UPGRADE
-------
To upgrade from a previous version simply upload the files from the new version as described in step 1) of the installation.
There should be no need to re-install anything or change any settings as I've tried to pay attention to backwards compatibility during development.
Please get in touch if you experience any issues.



UNINSTALL
---------
In OpenCart admin, go to the Extensions -> Modules page, and simply click 'Uninstall' next to ‘MineWhat Ecommerce Analytics.
This will ensure the configuration settings are deleted and that none of the main functions of the mod will run.
Some files will still remain - however these should be perfectly safe and not affect anything but to fully remove please delete all files which you uploaded during the install.
